# TradingVue.js

**TradingVue.js** is a hackable charting lib for traders. You can draw literally ANYTHING on top of candlestick charts.

## Why?

I've been using [TradingView.com](https://www.tradingview.com) for several years and oh boy, I like this service.
But when it came to writing custom trading software there was no charting library with the same level of usability, not even near. There **WAS** no lib.
